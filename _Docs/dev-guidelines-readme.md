# MarketMultiplier.ai Development Guidelines

## Project Philosophy
Our development approach prioritizes:
- User-centric design
- Modular and scalable architecture
- Balancing sophistication with simplicity

## Code Style and Conventions

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for strong typing
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use explicit type annotations
- Avoid `any` type when possible

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer destructuring props
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Use meaningful prop and variable names

### State Management
- Utilize React Context for global state
- Create custom hooks for complex state logic
- Minimize prop drilling
- Use context providers at appropriate levels

### Styling
- Exclusively use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Avoid inline styles
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Prioritize responsive design

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Stable production branch
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/description`

### Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Provide clear, concise descriptions

### Pull Request Process
- Link PRs to related issues
- Require code review from at least one team member
- Pass all automated tests before merging
- Squash and merge for clean history

## Performance Best Practices
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Use React.memo and useMemo for complex calculations
- Lazy load components and routes
- Optimize context updates

## Testing
- Write unit tests for components and hooks
- Use React Testing Library
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test both happy paths and edge cases

## AI Integration Guidelines
- Modularize AI-related logic
- Create abstraction layers for AI services
- Handle potential AI service failures gracefully
- Provide fallback mechanisms

## Security Considerations
- Never expose sensitive information in client-side code
- Use environment variables for configurations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs

## Documentation
- Keep README files up to date
- Document complex logic and component purposes
- Use TypeScript type definitions as documentation
- Maintain inline comments for non-obvious implementations

## Continuous Integration
- Automate code quality checks
- Run linters and formatters
- Integrate automated testing
- Deploy staging environments automatically

## Accessibility Guidelines
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Use semantic HTML
- Provide proper aria labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation

## Performance Monitoring
- Use React DevTools
- Implement performance profiling
- Monitor bundle sizes
- Optimize asset loading

## UI/UX Best Practices

### User Feedback
- Implement real-time save indicators using AutosaveIndicator component
- Use consistent feedback patterns across standalone modules
- AutosaveIndicator should be used in all standalone feature modules (not in walkthrough steps)
- Keep feedback subtle but visible (bottom-right corner positioning)
- Provide clear visual states for saving/saved conditions

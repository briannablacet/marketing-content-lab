My wishlist


MVP

1) Marketing Walkthrough (accessible from home page and a few other links).
Should include (in order):

-First page (content will have to change on this. We are turning this into a content marketing program buider now, not just a marketing program builder). Give a preview of what the app will do. Remove the revenue goal. 

-Second page: Tell me about your product or service
    * What is it called?
    * What kind of product is it?
    * Value proposition (What makes your solution extraordinary?)
    * What is unique about your product (allow them to enter up to 5 key benefits)
Page 2a) Show a summary of what they created on the Second page. let them go back and edit, if they like.

-Third page: Who are we delighting with your solution? 
    * Enter target personas (up to 3)
    What problems does your product solve for them? (Allow up to 5 answers)
Page 3a) Summarize what they creted on the Third page. Give them an option to go back and edit if they like.

-Fourth page: Who is your competition and how is your solution different?
    * List up to three top competitors
    * List up to five differentiators
Page 4a) Show a summary of what they creted on page four. Let them go back to edit if they like.

Notes you gave me from a previous roadmap: Build competitor website analysis functionality. Create competitor message extraction. Implement differentiator identification
Add opportunity analysis. Create visualization of competitive messaging landscape (if this is too complicated, we can save this for a future release)

-Fifth page: Make some kind of positive, encouraging comment about everything they've entered so far. 
    * Ask "Would you like me to help you with your messaging?" If user clicks "yes," use AI to craft some great key messages and a value prop. If the user clicks "no," move on to the next page.
Page 5a) Show a summary of what they created on page five. Let them go back and edit if theylike. 

-Sixth page: How does your message compare to your competitors? (Visit competitor's website or use what you have in your model and create a list of competitor's messaging)
    * As you list each line item of competitive messaging, add some text underneath that indicates how the user's messaging is different and/or some suggestions for how to differentiate and/or competitive messaging opportunities.
Page 6a) Show a summary of what they've created. Let them go back and edit if they like.

-Seventh page: Enter SEO keywords

- Eighth: Let's choose your marketing mix. This page will use the existing content strategy module, where the user can select the types of content they want to create. 

Note: Skip budget screen, skip ROI calculator, skip the planner. Eliminate pipeline projects/lead forecasts/lead scoring page/SDR Workspace (although we'll let them create SDR content in the other content creation process). We will omit these for our MVP.

-Ninth page: Using the list of content selections they made on page 7, list a bunch of types of content that falls under each category and give them a checkbox to select all of it. For example, under "Thought Leadership," we currently have a number of types of content, including blogs, etc. Have a subhead for Thought Leadership (if that was one of the content types they selected) and list all the available Thought Leadership content. Let them choose what to create. As they select each one, give them the option to let Market Multiplier choose the topics or let them enter the topic. In other words, if they want MM to choose the topics, create content from the key messages and competitive differentiators. Otherwise, use their input to customize the content piece.

-Tenth page: Move on to selecting brand voice and writing style pages. Make sure there's room to (optionally) upload their own messaging framework and/or company writing style guide (as well as the options we currently give them on those existing pages).

Note: make sure we have encouraging messages plus an emoji on each page of this walkthrough

-Eleventh page: Congratulate them on putting all the pieces in place. Show a list of what they've created. Make this look like the current step 9 of the marketing walkthrough. Let them click to edit anything they've entered. 
* Give link to the creation hub (I think that's what it is that gives you a button for each type of content and says "Create"). Let them choose to create all of them, as well. 

-Twelfth page: If they chose the Content Creation hub page, show them that you've created all the content they have selected. Somehow (I don't know what this would look like), give them an option to either view each one, save each one, download each one individually, or download all of them. Right now, we give them the option to download it or email it to themselves. If there is an email flow, label each item to show the order in the sequence.

- Final walkthrough page: Congratulate them on creating content. This completes the walkthrough. But we also need to give them links to the Content Enhancer and the Content Repurposer. Sort of "Well done! What would you like to do next?" Also give them a link to return to the dashboard. 

Note: in every stage of the walkthrough, give them the option to abandon the walkthrough and go back to the dashboard. Save whatever they've done. Also, feel free to change the flow based on user selection, conditionally, if it makes sense.

2) Standalone pages (please order these somewhat logically):

* Describe your solution (let them edit what they entered)
* Target personas (go back to the "who are we delighting" screen)
* Refine your messaging (take them back to the key messages page and let them edit it) 
* Competitive analysis (here let them also add new competitors or change what they entered. Show them the competitive messaging opportunities we established on page 4 of the walkthrough )
* Content Creator (start with the existing content selection page and then take them through pages 9/10/11)
* Content Enhancer (allow them to upload a document to enhance or select something we've created for them). Give them some starter prompts, like "Make this shorter/Make this longer and add detail/Make this more conversational/Make this more formal. Claude, please let me know if you have other prompt ideas, or we can just start with this. Give them an option to optimize for SEO. Use the keywords they enetered. If they have not entered keywords, use AI to come up with a good list, keeping competitors' content in mind, as well. 
* Content Repurposer: In this one, let them select or upload existing content and give them options to change the form. In other words, if they select a blog, give them a list of other forms that are available, such as eBook, social posts, ads, landing page, white paper. Output the new content, let them save and/or download (in other words, this goes back to the content on page 11 of the walkthrough)
* Optimize for SEO (show keyword screen)
* Customize writing style (go back to the writing style page from the walkthrough)
* Customize brand voice (go back to the brand voice page from the walkthrough)

Note: on every page and at every opportunity, offer AI assistance.

Note: eventually, we'll have to do a user registration, etc. Let's skip it for MVP.

Note: give me any suggestions you have and point out where I've specified something that doesn't work.
